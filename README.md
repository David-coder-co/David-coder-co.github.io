#### MNIST Random Forest Classification 
Built and evaluated an image classification model using the Random Forest Classifier on the MNIST dataset. The project involved preprocessing image data, training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and assessing performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. This study explores the effectiveness of tree-based models for digit recognition compared to deep learning approaches.

#### Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- Image Processing: OpenCV, Scikit-image (if used)
- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Coffee Sales Analysis 
Analyzed coffee sales transactions from a vending machine dataset to uncover key sales trends, customer preferences, and purchasing behaviors. This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify peak sales periods, popular coffee choices, and seasonal trends. The insights help optimize inventory management and pricing strategies.

### Technologies Used:
